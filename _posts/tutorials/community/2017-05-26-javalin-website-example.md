## What You Will Learn

You will learn how to create a basic Javalin application with filters,
controllers, views, authentication, localization, error handling, and more.
However, this is not really a full blown tutorial, it's more a description of a
basic structure, with certain points of the code highlighted. To get the full
benefit of this tutorial, please clone the example on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin-website-example) run it, and play around.

[A live demo can be found here](http://javalin-website-example.herokuapp.com/index)

## Package structure
<img src="/img/posts/websiteExample/packageOverview.png" alt="Package Structure">

As you can see, the app is packaged by feature and not by layer.
If you need to be convinced that this is a good approach,
please have a look at [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsjsiz2A9mg&feature=youtu.be&t=416)
by Robert C. Martin.

## Application.java

This is the class that ties your app together.
When you open this class, you should get an immediate
understanding of how everything works:

~~~java
public class Application {

    // Declare dependencies
    public static BookDao bookDao;
    public static UserDao userDao;

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Instantiate your dependencies
        bookDao = new BookDao();
        userDao = new UserDao();

        Javalin app = Javalin.create()
            .enableStaticFiles("/public", Location.CLASSPATH)
            .start(7000);

        app.routes(() -> {
            before(Filters.stripTrailingSlashes);
            before(Filters.handleLocaleChange);
            before(LoginController.ensureLoginBeforeViewingBooks);
            get(Path.Web.INDEX, IndexController.serveIndexPage);
            get(Path.Web.BOOKS, BookController.fetchAllBooks);
            get(Path.Web.ONE_BOOK, BookController.fetchOneBook);
            get(Path.Web.LOGIN, LoginController.serveLoginPage);
            post(Path.Web.LOGIN, LoginController.handleLoginPost);
            post(Path.Web.LOGOUT, LoginController.handleLogoutPost);
        });

        app.error(404, ViewUtil.notFound);
    }

}
~~~

### Before-handlers, endpoints and error mapping
If your application is small, declaring before-handlers, endpoints-handlers, and after-handlers all
in the same location greatly improves the readability of your code.
Just by looking at the class above, you can tell that there's a filter that
strips trailing slashes from all endpoints (`/books/` `->` `/books`) and that any request
can handle a locale change. You also get an overview of all the endpoints, and that
there is an error-mapper for 404 errors.

### Static dependencies?
This is probably not what you learned in Java class, but I believe statics
are better than dependency injection when dealing with web applications / controllers.
Injecting dependencies makes everything a lot more ceremonious, and as can be seen in
[this example](https://glot.io/snippets/efivlwbva5) you need about twice the amount of
code for the same functionality. I think it complicates things without providing
any real benefit, and before you say **unit-testing**: you're not launching this thing
into space, so you don't need to test everything. If you want to test your controllers,
then [acceptance-tests](https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium)
are superior to mocking and unit-tests, as they test your application in the
exact state it'll be in when it's deployed.

### Path.Web and Controller.handler
It's usually a good idea to keep your paths in some sort of constant.
In the code example above I have a `Path` class with a subclass `Web`
(it also has a subclass `Template`), which holds public final static Strings.
That's just my preference, it's up to you how you want to do this.
All my handlers are declared as `static Handler` fields, grouping together
functionality in the same classes (based on feature). Let's have a look at the `LoginController`:

~~~java
public static Handler serveLoginPage = ctx -> {
    Map<String, Object> model = ViewUtil.baseModel(ctx);
    model.put("loggedOut", removeSessionAttrLoggedOut(ctx));
    model.put("loginRedirect", removeSessionAttrLoginRedirect(ctx));
    ctx.render(Path.Template.LOGIN, model);
};

public static Handler handleLoginPost = ctx -> {
    Map<String, Object> model = ViewUtil.baseModel(ctx);
    if (!UserController.authenticate(getQueryUsername(ctx), getQueryPassword(ctx))) {
        model.put("authenticationFailed", true);
        ctx.render(Path.Template.LOGIN, model);
    } else {
        ctx.sessionAttribute("currentUser", getQueryUsername(ctx));
        model.put("authenticationSucceeded", true);
        model.put("currentUser", getQueryUsername(ctx));
        if (getQueryLoginRedirect(req) != null) {
            ctx.redirect(getQueryLoginRedirect(ctx));
        }
        ctx.render(Path.Template.LOGIN, model);
    }
};

public static Handler handleLogoutPost = ctx -> {
    ctx.sessionAttribute("currentUser", null);
    ctx.sessionAttribute("loggedOut", "true");
    ctx.redirect(Path.Web.LOGIN);
};

// The origin of the request (ctx.path()) is saved in the session so
// the user can be redirected back after login
public static Handler ensureLoginBeforeViewingBooks = ctx -> {
    if (!ctx.path().startsWith("/books")) {
        return;
    }
    if (ctx.sessionAttribute"currentUser") == null) {
        ctx.sessionAttribute("loginRedirect", ctx.path());
        ctx.redirect(Path.Web.LOGIN);
    }
};
~~~

The above methods contain all the functionality that is related to login/logout.
The `serveLoginPage` handler inspects the request session and puts necessary variables
in the view model (did the user just log out? is there a uri to redirect the user to after login?),
then renders the page. The `ensureLoginBeforeViewingBooks` Handler is used in a `before()`.

## Localization
Localization in Java is pretty straightforward.
You create two properties files with different suffixes,
for example `messages_en.properties` (english) and
`messages_de.properties` (german), then you create a ResourceBundle:

~~~java
ResourceBundle.getBundle("localization/messages", new Locale("en"));
~~~

The setup is a bit more elaborate if you clone the application
(I created a small wrapper object with two methods),
but the basics are very simple, and only uses native Java.

## Rendering views
Javalin has native support on the `Context` object for rendering templates.
Let's look at the login-page again:

~~~java
public static Handler serveLoginPage = ctx -> {
    Map<String, Object> model = ViewUtil.baseModel(req);
    model.put("loggedOut", removeSessionAttrLoggedOut(req));
    model.put("loginRedirect", removeSessionAttrLoginRedirect(req));
    ctx.render(Path.Template.LOGIN, model);
};
~~~
The template needs access to the request to check the locale and the current users,
which we get from the `ViewUtil.baseModel(req)` method.

## Example view
This code snippet shows the view for the `fetchOneBook` `Handler`, which displays one book:

~~~markup
#parse("/velocity/layout.vm")
#@mainLayout()
    #if($book)
        <h1>$book.getTitle()</h1>
        <h2>$book.getAuthor()</h2>
        <img src="$book.largeCover" alt="$book.title">
    #else
        <h1>$msg.get("BOOKS_BOOK_NOT_FOUND")</h1>
    #end
#end
~~~

If the book is present, display it. Else, show a localized message saying the
book was not found by using the `msg` object that was put into the model earlier using `ViewUtil.baseModel(req)`.
The view uses a layout template `@#mainLayout()` which is the page frame (styles, scripts, navigation, footer, etc.).

## Conclusion
Hopefully you've learned a bit about Javalin, and also Java and webapps in general.
Please clone the example and suggest improvements on GitHub.
