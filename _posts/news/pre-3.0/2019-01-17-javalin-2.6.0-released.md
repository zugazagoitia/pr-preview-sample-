title: Server-sent events support!
summary: Javalin finally has a Server-sent events implementation.

## Server-sent events
Server-sent events has been requested a lot in Javalin, and thanks to two contributors
([@7agustibm](https://github.com/7agustibm) and [@firxworx](https://github.com/firxworx)),
we now have an implementation. As with most Javalin APIs, the syntax is lambda based:


```kotlin
val clients = ConcurrentLinkedQueue<SseClient>()

app.sse("/sse") { client ->
    clients.add(client)
    client.sendEvent("connected", "Hello, SSE")
    client.onClose { clients.remove(client) }
}

while (true) {
    for (client in clients) {
        client.sendEvent("PING")
    }
    Thread.sleep(1000)
}
```

A corresponding JavaScript client would look something like:
```js
const eventSource = new EventSource("http://localhost:7000/sse");
eventSource.addEventListener("connected", msg => console.log(msg);
```

Server-sent events is also known as "EventSource", and is useful for when you need to push events to clients (to avoid polling).

## Misc
* Fixed a bug introduced in `2.5.0` which made "catch-all" exception-mappers interfere with `HttpResponseException` exceptions
* Added method for retrieving the request context path from `Context`
* `Javalin#addHandler` is now public, this is the internal method that get/post/put/etc call
* Bumped Jetty
