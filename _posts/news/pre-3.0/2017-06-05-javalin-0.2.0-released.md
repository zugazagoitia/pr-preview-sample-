title: Javalin rewritten in Kotlin
summary: Kotlin love!
---

Most of Javalin was re-written to Kotlin in version 0.2.0. The SAM interfaces were left
as Java, as well as the main Javalin-class which has method-declarations with SAM parameters.
This had to be done due to limitations in Kotlin itself ([https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-14151](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-14151),
[https://devnet.jetbrains.com/thread/461516](https://devnet.jetbrains.com/thread/461516))\\
The rest of the library will be ported to Kotlin if this issue is resolved, or and alternative solution is discovered.
