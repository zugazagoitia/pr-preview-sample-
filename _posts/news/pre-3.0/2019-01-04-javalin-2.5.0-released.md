title: App extensions and single-page improvements
summary: Added extensions to Javalin instances. Made single-page mode work with external files. Some minor bugfixes.
---

## App extensions

You can now create app-extensions by calling `app.register(appExtension)`.
The `Extension` interface is a simple lambda with access to the current Javalin app:

```java
Javalin.create()
    .register(app -> { ... }) // register lambda
    .register(new ExtensionClass(...)); // ExtensionClass must implement Extension
```

You can (for example) create a `DosFilter` that you use across multiple Javalin apps, and add it to each app by calling `app.register(new DosFilter())`.

The feature is inspired by the `register` function in Sinatra: [http://sinatrarb.com/extensions.html](http://sinatrarb.com/extensions.html#extending-the-dsl-class-context-with-sinatraregister)

## Single-page mode improvements

* You can now use external (non classpath) files for your single-page entrypoint (`index.html`)
* Single-page entry point (`index.html`) is no longer cached if host is localhost

## Bugfixes and misc

* You can now call `ctx.resultString()` in request loggers (after the response has been written).
* You can now set the context-path in `EmbeddedJavalin`
* Static resource handling now has a `ResourceHandler` interface, so you can use your own resource handler if you're extending Javalin
* An error is now logged if user attempts to read request body twice, and body is not cached
* Improved custom handling of `HttpResponseException`
