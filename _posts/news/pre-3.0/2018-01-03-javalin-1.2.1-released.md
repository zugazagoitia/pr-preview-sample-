title: Bumps, bugfixes, cleanup
summary: Updated Jetty and Kotlin and fixed bug in TemplateUtil
---

## Dependency bumps
Jetty has been bumped to `9.4.8.v20171121`. Kotlin has been bumped to `1.2.10`. 
There were no breaking changes in either bump.

## TemplateUtil#model bugfix
The `model` function used to be `vararg args: Any`, but has been changed to `vararg args: Any?`.
Nullables are perfectly fine for template-models.

## Cleanup
Some minor code cleanup was performed, but it shouldn't affect anyone.
