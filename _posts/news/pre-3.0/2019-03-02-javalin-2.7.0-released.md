## Configure your WebSocketServletFactory

It's now possible to configure the object which creates WebSocket connections in Javalin.
This can be done through `app.wsFactoryConfig()`:

```kotlin
app.wsFactoryConfig { wsFactory ->
    wsFactory.policy.maxTextMessageSize = 1234;
    wsFactory.policy.idleTimeout = 1234;
    wsFactory.extensionFactory.register(...)
    wsFactory.register(...)
}
```

This gives you access to a lot of low level settings for WebSockets.
For details, see the [Jetty docs](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/9.4.15.v20190215/org/eclipse/jetty/websocket/servlet/WebSocketServletFactory.html).

## Misc
* Added some missing overrides in `EmbeddedJavalin`
* Made it possible to use nested paths in `CrudHandler`
* Bumped Jetty to the latest version
