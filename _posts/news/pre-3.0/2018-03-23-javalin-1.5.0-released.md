title: WebSocket paths, route overview, multipart improvements
summary: Enhanced WebSocket lambdas, added an automatically generated route overview, 
  made improvements to multipart-forms and added Javadoc to public API
---

## WebsSocket improvements
One of the most requests WebSocket features has been the ability to use dynamic paths, like `/:param`. 
This has finally been added:

```kotlin
ws("/chat/:channel") { ws ->
    ws.onMessage { session, message ->
        val channel = session.param("channel")
        broadcastMessage(channel, message)
    }
}
```

More convenience methods for extracting information from the upgrade-request were also added:
```kotlin
session.paramMap() // get all param key/values as map
session.header("key") // get a header
session.headerMap() // get all header key/values as map
session.host() // get request host
```

## Route overview
You can now generate an overview of all the mapped paths in your application and host it on a path of your choice:

```kotlin
val app = Javalin.create().apply {
    enableRouteOverview("route-overview")
}
```

The route-overview will show the verb, the path, the function/field/class handling the request, and any roles attached to the handler:

## Multipart fields

Previously the Apache FileUpload dependency was required in order to receive uploaded files, and multipart-fields simply didn't work.
You can now access multipart-fields via the normal form-param function (`ctx.formParam("name")`), and Apache FileUpload
is no longer necessary in order to receive uploaded files (the public API remains unchanged).

### Misc/Bugfixes
* Jetty was bumped to `9.4.9.v20180320` which was released very recently. There were no breaking changes.
* Fixed some minor bugs in path-prefixing in `ApiBuilder`
