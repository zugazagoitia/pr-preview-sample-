## Custom JSON mapper
`Context#json` used to rely on Jackson to do JSON mapping. As of `1.7.0` it relies on `JavalinJsonPlugin`.
This plugin holds a default implementation for Jackson, but can be configured to use whatever you like.

This is how to use GSON instead of Jackson:

```java
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().create();
JavalinJsonPlugin.setJsonToObjectMapper(gson::fromJson);
JavalinJsonPlugin.setObjectToJsonMapper(gson::toJson);
```

## jTwig templates
jTwig is the Java implementation of a very popular PHP template engine.
This can now be used via `Context#renderJtwig`.

## Miscellaneous
* `Javalin`'s constructor is now `protected` instead of `private`. This means you can subclass `Javalin`.
* `Javalin` now has `disableStartupBanner()`, which removes the Javalin banner from logs
* `Javalin` will now print more helpful error messages if the current port can't be used.

## Context extensions

Context extensions give Java developers a way of extending the `Context` object.

One of the most popular features of Kotlin is [extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html).
When working with an object you don't own in Java, you often end up making `MyUtil.action(object, ...)`.
If you, for example, want to serialize an object and set it as the result on the `Context`, you might do:

```java
app.get("/", ctx -> MyMapperUtil.serialize(ctx, myMapper, myObject)); // three args, what happens where?
```

With context extensions you can add custom extensions on the context:

```java
app.get("/", ctx -> ctx.use(MyMapper.class).serialize(object)); // use MyMapper to serialize object
```

Context extensions have to be added before you can use them, this would typically be done in the first `before` filter of your app:

```java
app.before(ctx -> ctx.register(MyMapper.class, new MyMapper(ctx, otherDependency));
```

You could also create a general extension class which holds all your extensions:

```java
VelocityEngine velocityEngine = new VelocityEngine();
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().create();

app.before(ctx -> ctx.register(Ext.class, new Ext(ctx, gson, velocityEngine)));
```

Extensions are very powerful, you can use them for any action performed on the `Context`.
Another example is parameter extraction:

```java
public class Ext {
    private Context ctx;
    public Ext(Context ctx) {
        this.ctx = ctx;
    }
    public String formUsername() {
        String username = ctx.formParam("username");
        if (userName == null) {
            throw new InvalidFormException();
        }
        return username;
    }
    public String userLocale() {
        return ctx.queryParam("locale");
    }
}

app.post(ctx -> {
    String username = ctx.use(Ext.class).formUsername();
    String locale = ctx.use(Ext.class).userLocale();
});
```

As you see with the `throw`, extensions can also complicate your application. Use them with caution.
