title: GZIP, CORS and WebSocket improvements
summary: Added dynamic GZIP and new features for CORS and WebSockets
---

## New features

* Added `enableDynamicGzip()` option to gzip any response over 1500 bytes
* Added `*` as possible origin so you can do `enableCorsForOrigin("*")`
* Added `enableCorsForAllOrigins()` which just calls the above ^
* Added `session.send()` and different `session.queryParam()` methods to websocket `session` object

## Bugfixes

* `isMultipart()` now checks for any type of multipart (previously just `multipart/form-data`)
