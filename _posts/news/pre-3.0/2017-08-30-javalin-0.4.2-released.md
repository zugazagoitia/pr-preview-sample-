title: Internal refactoring and Jetty-changes
summary: Improved logging and static file handling

## Improved response handling and logging

Javalin previously used a `PrintWriter` to write responses,
while Jetty copied to the response `OutputStream`.
For logging, Javalin used a custom `PrintWriter` that would copy the response,
but this would not catch responses written by Jetty (static files).
Javalin now uses a custom `OutputStream` for response-logging,
so every response (both Javalin and Jetty-handled) is logged.

Request-logger no longer includes the body of multipart-requests.

## Static resource improvements

* GZIP has been enabled
* Cache-control is now set to `max-age=0` by default, which means that
  clients will always ask Jetty if files have been updated - unless:
* If you put files in a dir called `immutable`, then `max-age` will be set to one year.
  This should only be used for versioned library files, like `vue-2.4.2.min.js`

## New functions on Context
* `ctx.renderMarkdown("/path/to/markdown-file.md")` - render and serve a markdown-file
* `ctx.isMultipart()` check if request is multipart
