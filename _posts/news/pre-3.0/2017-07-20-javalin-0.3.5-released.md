title: Query-param improvements
summary: Added two helpful methods for query params
---

### ctx.mapQueryParams()
This feature is mostly useful for Kotlin users,
as it allows for very neat query-param declaration with destructuring and elvis-throws:

```kotlin
app.post("/new-user") { ctx ->
    val (name, email) = ctx.mapQueryParams("name", "email") ?: throw MissingQueryParamException()
}
```

### ctx.anyQueryParamNull()
This is band-aid for Java developers who can't use `ctx.mapQueryParams()`,
at least you can make sure that your query-params are present:
```java
app.post("/new-user", ctx ->
    if (ctx.anyQueryParamNull("name", "email")) {
        throw new MissingQueryParamException();
    }
});
```

#### Minor change in `before`/`after`
Previously `before` and `after` used `/*` as path when called pathless (like `before(handler)`).
This has been changed to `*`, in order to include the root path (`/`).
