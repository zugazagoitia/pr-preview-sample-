title: WebSocket and static files improvements
summary: Added id to WsSession and option to add multiple static files locations
---

## WebSocket improvements
* Jetty WebSocket module is now bundled with Javalin, there is no need to add it separately. 
  If your project already has the WebSocket dependency declared this can now be removed.
* Each WsSession now has an ID that you can access via `session.id`

## Multiple Static Files locations
You can now call `enableStaticFiles` as many times as you want. Each call will add a new handler:

```kotlin
val app = Javalin.create().apply {
    enableStaticFiles("/public/a")
    enableStaticFiles("/public/b")
    enableStaticFiles("src/test/external/", Location.EXTERNAL)
}.start()
```

Handlers will be executed in the order they're declared.
