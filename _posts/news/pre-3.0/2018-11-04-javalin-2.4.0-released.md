## Javalin without Jetty
If you want to use Javalin with an application server or a servlet container, such as Tomcat, WebLocic, etc,
you can use `EmbeddedJavalin.createServlet()`:

```kotlin
@WebServlet(urlPatterns = ["/rest/*"], name = "MyServlet")
class MyServlet : HttpServlet() {
    val javalin = EmbeddedJavalin()
        .get("/rest") { ctx -> ctx.result("Hello!") }
        .createServlet()

    override fun service(req: HttpServletRequest, resp: HttpServletResponse) {
        javalin.service(req, resp)
    }
}
```

The `createServlet()` method is the same method that Javalin uses internally when attaching itself to Jetty.
Jetty server methods like `app.contextPath()`, `app.start()`, etc, will throw exceptions if called on `EmbeddedJavalin`.
You have to manually exclude Jetty from your build files if you want to use this approach.

## WebSockets
- You can now easily add WebSocket loggers by calling `app.wsLogger()`. The method takes a `WsHandler`,
(the same interface as a normal `app.ws()` call), and can be used to log events of all types.
  The logger runs after the WebSocket handler for the endpoint
- `app.enableDebugLogging()` now includes extensive WebSocket logging.
- Fixed a NPE if calling `queryParamMap` when there was no query string.

## Exception mapping
- You can now add a custom exception handler to override the built-in handler for `HttpResponseException`
- The default "Internal server error" for uncaught exceptions now uses the `InternalServerErrorResponse` instead of a plaintext String
- ExceptionMapper now takes `defaultContentType` into account

## Jetty
- Extended support for wrapped and nested Jetty handlers
- The `SessionHandler` is now validated before starting the Server
- "Jetty is listening on {...}" message now includes the context path

## Misc
- You can now get the matched path of an endpoint in an `after` filter by using `ctx.endpointHandlerPath()`
- You can now use the `head` verb in the `ApiBuilder`
- Added support for double extensions for templates (like `.html.ext`)
- Added missing @Nullable/@NotNull annotations
- The `onBinaryMessage` WebSocket handler now throws `Exception`
- The CORS options method is no longer managed by the `AccessManager`
