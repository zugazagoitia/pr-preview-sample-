## Some minor adjustments

* Trailing slashes can now be un-ignored by calling `app.dontIgnoreTrailingSlashes()`
* Added `mapFormParams()` and `anyFormParamNull()` functions
* Added log-message for static-file configuration
* Added `start(port)` method for quick-starting the server
* Added render-overloads for template engines that don't require a map
* Added `@JvmStatic` annotations to template engines, so `INSTANCE` is no longer required when calling methods from Java
