summary: Nullable attributes, improved exception handling, encoding fixes
---

## Nullable attributes
The following functions on the `Context` class are now correctly marked as nullable:

```kotlin
fun <T> attribute(attribute: String): T?
fun <T> attributeMap(): Map<String, T?>
fun <T> sessionAttribute(attribute: String): T?
fun <T> sessionAttributeMap(): Map<String, T?>
```

This change only affects Kotlin users.

## Improved exception handling in async handlers
Javalin 2.0.0 introduced an exception handler for the `CompletionException` class.
Unfortunately, this handler interfered with user-defined exception handlers. This has been fixed in 2.1.1. The
default exception handler only handles `CompletionException` if the cause is a `HttpResponseExceptions` now.

## Fixed encoding issues for `json()` and `html()` functions
The `json()` and `html()` functions on `Context` used to set the result stream before setting the content-type.
This would lead to the result being written with the wrong encoding in some environments. This has been fixed.

## Opening the Context class
The `Context` class is now `open` (not final anymore). This should make mocking easier for some mocking frameworks.
