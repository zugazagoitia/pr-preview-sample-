<div class="notification" markdown="1">
1.4.0 introduced a couple of bugs. The good news is we've
fixed them in [1.4.1](/news/2018/03/04/javalin-1.4.1-released.html).
</div>

## Features
GitHub user [ShikaSD](https://github.com/ShikaSD) has contributed a lot of new config options and features:

### Config options
```kotlin
val app = Javalin.create().apply {
    defaultContentType(string) // set a default content-type for responses
    defaultCharacterEncoding(string) // set a default character-encoding for responses
    maxBodySizeForRequestCache(long) // set max body size for request cache
    disableRequestCache() // disable request caching
}
```

### Other features
* Route declarations can now accept regex patterns (`app.get("/:param/[0-9]+/") { ... }`)

## Bugfixes
* `ctx.redirect(path, status)` used to ignore status-code, always using `302`. This has been fixed.
* `CacheRequestWrapper` used to not provide access to the `InputStream` for requests if `Transfer-Encoding` was chunked. This has been fixed.
* Dynamic GZIP only worked for `ctx.result(string)` before, now it also works for `ctx.result(stream)`
