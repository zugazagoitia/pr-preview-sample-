title: Some bugfixes and bumps
summary: Fixes bug in redirects and body-reading
---

## Bugfixes
1.4.0 attempted to fix some bugs, and introduced new bugs in the process (as is tradition).
Hopefully the bugfixes in 1.4.1 will prove less buggy.

### Redirects 
Redirects were broken in certain cases by the 1.4.0 release. We switched away from 
`HttpServletRequest#sendRedirect()` to handling them manually, but we didn't halt execution.  
This resulted in 404's for redirects from before-filters in certain cases. This should be fixed now.

### Query-params and reading request body
1.4.0 introduced lazy caching of the request body. This resulted in some bugs when using `Context#queryParam`
(which uses `HttpServletRequest#getParameter`), which caused the body to be drained before it could be cached. 
Query-params are now parsed from `HttpServletRequest#getQueryString`, which should be a 
better solution all around.

## Bumps
* Kotlin has been bumped to 1.2.30
