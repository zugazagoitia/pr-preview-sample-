title: Request-logs and form-params
summary: Added request-logging and improved form-params with three more functions
---

## Added more `ctx.formParam`-functions
Previously there was only `ctx.formParam()` to get a single form-param,
now form-params have the same functionality as query-params:

```kotlin
formParam("key") // get one form-params
formParamOrDefault("key", "default") // get one form-params (or default if null)
formParams("key") // get multiple form-paramss
formParamMap() // get map of all form-params key/values
```

## Added request-logging
You can enable request-logging by calling `ctx.enableStandardRequestLogging()`,
or by calling `requestLogLevel(LogLevel logLevel)`. The current LogLevels are:

### LogLevel.OFF
Request-logging is off by default.

### LogLevel.MINIMAL
```markdown
INFO - POST -> 200 (0.16 ms)
```

### LogLevel.STANDARD
```markdown
INFO - POST /endpoint-path -> 200 [text/plain;charset=utf-8] (took 0.15 ms)
```

### LogLevel.EXTENSIVE
The `EXTENSIVE` level wraps the `ServletResponse` and uses a custom `PrintWriter` to copy the content.
This operation is somewhat expensive, so you shouldn't use it if you need performance.

```markdown
INFO - JAVALIN EXTENSIVE REQUEST LOG (this clones the response, which is an expensive operation):
Request: POST [/some-endpoint]
    Headers: {User-Agent=unirest-java/1.3.11, Connection=keep-alive, Host=localhost:51958, Accept-Encoding=gzip, Content-Length=4, Content-Type=text/plain; charset=UTF-8}
    Cookies: {}
    Body: body=mybody
    QueryString: qp=queryparam
    QueryParams: {qp=[queryparam]}
    FormParams: {body=[mybody]}
Response: [200], execution took 0.27 ms
    Headers: {Server=Javalin, Date=Sat, 19 Aug 2017 09:11:12 GMT, Content-Type=text/plain;charset=utf-8}
