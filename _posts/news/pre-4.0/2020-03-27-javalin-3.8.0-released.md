title: HTTP range request support and other improvements!
summary: Simple range request with ctx.seekableStream, session attributes in WebSocket handlers, and a lot of OpenAPI improvements.

## Seekable streams for HTTP range requests
Javalin finally supports streaming large files, which is mainly used for music and video:

{% capture java %}
app.get("/file", ctx -> {
    File file = new File("/my-file.mp3");
    ctx.seekableStream(new FileInputStream(file), "audio/mpeg");
});
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
app.get("/file") { ctx ->
    val file = File("/my-file.mp3")
    ctx.seekableStream(file.inputStream(), "audio/mpeg")
}
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippetKotlinFirst.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}

Using `ctx.seekableStream` enables seeking ("skipping") in audio and video players, as well as resuming downloads of larger files.

## WebSocket session attributes (and context path change)
We spoke with the people running the Jetty project, and it turns out that the way Javalin has been attaching
the `WebSocketServlet` and `HttpServlet` to Jetty is "non-standard" (but not completely disallowed).
We used to attach two `ServletContextHandler` objects to the Jetty `Server`, which caused some issues
with sessions not being linked. We only use one `ServletContextHandler` now, which means that the
`config.wsContextPath` config variable had to be removed, but it also means that we finally have
session attributes working in WebSocket handlers!

This should make it a much easier to authenticate your WebSocket requests:

{% capture java %}
app.ws("/", ws -> {
    ws.onConnect(ctx -> {
        ctx.sessionAttribute("current-user");
    });
});
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
app.ws("/") { ws ->
    ws.onConnect { ctx ->
        ctx.sessionAttribute<String>("current-user")
    }
}
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippetKotlinFirst.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}

## OpenAPI improvements
* Added option to specify `security` (thanks to [@TobiasWalle](https://github.com/TobiasWalle)).
* Improved docs for endpoints with both file-uploads and form-params (thanks to [@manuelhuber](https://github.com/manuelhuber)).
* Added support for different content types in `formDataBody` (thanks to [@TobiasWalle](https://github.com/TobiasWalle)).
* Added support for adding examples to models.
* Added missing boxed types (thanks to [@28Smiles](https://github.com/28Smiles)).
* Added support for multiple query param values (thanks to [@28Smiles](https://github.com/28Smiles)).
* Add assertion for multiple documentations of the same path (thanks to [@28Smiles](https://github.com/28Smiles)).
* Added support for beans in query params (thanks to [@28Smiles](https://github.com/28Smiles)).

## Misc features and fixes
* Added a `ByteArray`/`byte[]` overload to `Context#result` (thanks to [@danwallach](https://github.com/danwallach)).
* Added option to use jsDelivr for static resource on non localhost in JavalinVue plugin.
* The `RateLimit` class now takes load-balancers into account by checking `X-Forwarded-For` (previously just used ip).
* JSON deserialization errors now log `info` instead of `debug` in `ctx.bodyAsClass()`.
* The `staticInstance()` method of the `ApiBuilder` is now public, making the `ApiBuilder` easy to extend.
