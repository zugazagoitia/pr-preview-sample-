## JavalinVue security patch

The JavalinVue plugin includes query-parameters in the DOM, which made it possible to do XSS
injection. If you are using JavalinVue you should update to 3.10.1 as soon as possible.

If you are not using JavalinVue, then you can skip upgrading to 3.10.1, as there are no other fixes.
