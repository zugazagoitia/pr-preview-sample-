## RouteOverviewPlugin JSON

The `RouteOverviewPlugin` has been with Javalin since version 1.5.0.
It's a plugin which listens for `routeAdded` events and creates a HTML page displaying all the mapped routes:

<img src="/img/news/route-overview.png" alt="Route overview">

As of 3.4.1, this will be served as a JSON object if the client accepts json.
You can enable the `RouteOverviewPlugin` like this:

```java
Javalin.create(config ->
    config.registerPlugin(new RouteOverviewPlugin(path));        // show all routes on specified path
    config.registerPlugin(new RouteOverviewPlugin(path, roles)); // show all routes on specified path (with auth)
)
```

Thanks to [@dherges](https://github.com/dherges) for adding this feature.

## Fixes

* We're now using the newly created [Jvm-Brotli](https://github.com/nixxcode/jvm-brotli) instead of
  [jBrotli](https://github.com/meteogroup/jbrotli) (thanks to [@nixxcode](https://github.com/nixxcode)).
* The `JavalinVue` plugin now always uses UTF-8 for reading files. This fixes a bug when
  running on distroless docker images (or any OS which doesn't use UTF-8 by default).
* The `JavalinVue#stateFunction` is now a `@JvmField`.
* If an `EofException` occurs in `JavalinServlet` or `JettyResourceHandler` it's no longer logged.
  These exceptions occur if the client closes a connection before the response has been fully written (which is fine).
* The `WsContext` class now has `queryParam(key: String)` (thanks to [@bluedevil2k](https://github.com/bluedevil2k)).
