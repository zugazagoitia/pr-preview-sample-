summary: Multi-module, new Micrometer plugin, static file path-prefixes and pre-compression, Validator improvements.

## Multi module
Thanks to [chsfleury](https://github.com/chsfleury), Javalin is now a multi-module project. The available modules are

* `javalin` - the standard Javalin dependency, just as before
* `javalin-bundle` - `javalin`, `javalin-openapi`, `jackson` and `logback`
* `javalin-openapi` - the OpenAPI plugin and all required dependencies
* `javalin-graphql` - the new GraphQL plugin (thanks to [7agustibm](https://github.com/7agustibm))
* `javalin-without-jetty` - `javalin` with all `jetty` dependencies excluded
  and Jetty specific methods removed (useful for running on e.g. Tomcat)

The modules themselves can be considered stable, but which dependencies they pull in might change.

## New Micrometer plugin
The [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) team wrote a new implementation for the Micrometer plugin,
which according to them is on par with their Spring Boot integration. The previous implementation was very minimal.

## Static file improvements
* You can now pass a path-prefix to static files (`config.addStaticFiles("/hosted-path", "/directory")`)
* You can now pre-compress static files by setting `config.precompressStaticFiles = true`.
  This will store your compressible static files as highly compressed bytearrays (in memory),
  and will ensure that content-length is always set (thanks to [vn7n24fzkq](https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq))

## Validator improvements
Thanks to [thibaultmeyer](https://github.com/thibaultmeyer) and [MrThreepwood](https://github.com/MrThreepwood)
the [Validator](https://javalin.io/documentation#validation) API is a lot more flexible. You can now get a list
showing all errors (if there were multiple errors) so you can form a nicer response to the client.

## Misc fixes and improvements
* Fixed OpenAPI annotations for fields (thanks to [RalphSteinhagen](https://github.com/RalphSteinhagen))
* Fixed JSON escaping of `title` during `HttpException` mapping (thanks to [krig](https://github.com/krig))
* Added an exception for restarting a stopped server (thanks to [ashwinbhaskar](https://github.com/ashwinbhaskar))
* Made CORS plugin more strict (check full origin, not just startsWith) (thanks to [Jerbell](https://github.com/Jerbell))
