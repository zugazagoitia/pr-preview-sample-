## Don't ignore trailing slashes
You can now instruct Javalin to not ignore trailing slashes by doing `config.ignoreTrailingSlashes = false`.
This functionality used to exist in Javalin 2, but it was removed when refactoring the routing for Javalin 3.
Thanks to [NPi2Loup](https://github.com/NPi2Loup) for bringing it back.

## Static files bugfix
There used to be a bug in pre-compressed static files (disabled by default), which could lead to a concurrency bug.
Thanks to [vn7n24fzkq](https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq) for fixing it.

## JavalinVue improvements
* You can now set an `isDevFunction` function (previously this was just determined by checking if the request was on localhost)
* Added three new methods for inlining files in the layout template `@inlineFile`, `@inlineFileDev` and `@inlineFileNotDev`
* Added `JavalinVue.optimizeDependencies` config option. If set to true, JavalinVue will only load the dependencies required for your route component

## MultipartUtil configuration
You can now change the function that runs before files are uploaded through `MultipartUtil.preUploadFunction`.
This means you can specify your own `MultipartConfigElement`.
