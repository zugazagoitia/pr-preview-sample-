## JTE integration
[Jte](https://jte.gg/) is a new JVM template engine with compile time checking and an auto-complete plugin for IntelliJ.
The author [casid](https://github.com/casid) has also written a [tutorial](/tutorials/jte) on it. It's worth checking out if you're doing
server side templates.

## Misc fixes
* Fixed a bug in CORS plugin (`app.options("*")` has been replaced by a `before`)
* Exposed the default `ObjectMapper` from `JavalinJackson`
* Added the option to set local state for `VueComponent` instances
