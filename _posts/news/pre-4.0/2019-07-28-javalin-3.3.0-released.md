## Simplified error handling

Since the introduction of the standardized HTTP exceptions (like `BadRequestResponse()`),
the `app.error(status, handler)` method has been less useful.
Its main use now seems to be to render HTML error pages, so we've added an optional content-type to the method:

```kotlin
app.error(404, "html", my404PageHandler)
```

We've also made the `ErrorHandler` interface extend `Handler`, as it's really the same interface.
Because of backwards compatibility it can't be removed, but all `ErrorHandler` instances
are now valid `Handler` instances, and `app.error()` now takes a `Handler`.

## Optional Brotli
In 3.2.0, we included include Brotli as a non-optional dependency, but due to how
the Brotli artifact we depended on is published, this caused issues for some users (anyone using gradle).

As of 3.3.0, Brotli is an optional dependency, and we've also started work on creating a better
Brotli wrapper for the JVM. This will hopefully be included in the next version of Javalin.

## Bugfixes and test improvements

* Fixed a bug in how responses are written, which caused issues when compressing responses larger than 64kb
* Fixed a bug where certain files (images/audio/etc) were being compressed when they shouldn't have been
* Added Selenium and Chrome to the development test suite
