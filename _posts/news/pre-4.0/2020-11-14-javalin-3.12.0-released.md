title: New routing options! Improvements to ApiBuilder, static files, and OpenAPI.
summary: Added support for non sub-path wildcards, pathless crud calls in ApiBuilder, symlinks/aliases for static files, and more!
---

## Non sub-path wildcards
Javalin has always supported wildcard routing with `/path/*`. As of `3.12.0`, there's also support for doing
`/path*` and `/path/:param*`, which will match both `/path`+`/path/*` and `/path/:param`+`/path/:param/*` respectively.
This is particularly useful when you want to run a `before`/`after` handler for a resource (and all sub-paths of the resource).

## Pathless calls to `crud()` in `ApiBuilder`
You can now call `crud()` without a path argument, similar to the other methods in the `ApiBuilder`.
This means you can finally use `crud(MyHandler)` inside a `path()` call.

## Support for static file symlinks
You can now configure alias checking for resolving symlinks for static files.
This can be done through a `ContextHandler.AliasCheck` field, which can be configure on `config.aliasCheckForStaticFiles`:

```java
config.aliasCheckForStaticFiles = ContextHandler.AliasCheck { path, resource ->
    /* Your predicate here */
}
```

To allow all aliases, you can do `config.aliasCheckForStaticFiles = new ContextHandler.ApproveAliases();`

Thanks to [sealedtx](https://github.com/sealedtx) for implementing this.

## Redoc configuration

[LeoColman](https://github.com/LeoColman) has created a fully typed API for configuring Redoc in the OpenAPI plugin, big thanks!

```kotlin
.reDoc(ReDocOptions("/redoc", RedocOptionsObject(
    hideDownloadButton = true,
    theme = RedocOptionsTheme(
        spacingUnit = 10,
        isTypographyOptimizeSpeed = true
    )
))
```

## Misc fixes
* The OpenAPI plugin now skips `exampleSetFlag` on serialization (thanks to [pawel-piecyk](https://github.com/pawel-piecyk))
* Fixed issues with enums in OpenAPI plugin (thanks to [sealedtx](https://github.com/sealedtx))
* Fixed a bug in `ignoreTrailingSlashes` (thanks to [NPi2Loup](https://github.com/NPi2Loup))
* `Context#body` is now a lazy property (thanks to [ghn1712](https://github.com/ghn1712))
* The static instance in `ApiBuilder` is now thread-local (thanks to [kwbc](https://github.com/kwbc))
