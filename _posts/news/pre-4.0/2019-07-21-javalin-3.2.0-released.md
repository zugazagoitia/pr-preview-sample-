## Introducing Brotli compression!

Thanks to the hard work of [@nixxcode](https://github.com/nixxcode)
([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-petrovic/)),
Javalin now has support for Brotli compression (in addition to the existing GZIP support).

The new setting deprecates the old `dynamicGzip` setting.
You also get the option to change the compression level for both Brotli and Gzip.
This can be done by adding an int specifying the compression level:

```kotlin
Javalin.create { config ->
    config.dynamicGzip = true // deprecated
    config.compressionStrategy(Brotli(4), Gzip(6))
}
```

The change also moves compression handling for static files from Jetty to Javalin,
so static files compression can also be configured with the new setting.

To make all of this possible, the way responses are written in Javalin has been completely refactored.
Please let us know if you notice anything out of the ordinary.
