summary: Validation now supports nullable results, and a few bugs have been fixed in OpenApi and JavalinVue.

## Validation improvements
The validator now supports nullable values through `.getOrNull()`:

```kotlin
val optionalInstant = ctx.queryParam<Instant>("instant").getOrNull()
```

## Plugin improvements
* Minor fixes and changes to OpenAPI plugin (interface name, CORS, default values)
* Fixed a `NullPointerException` in the Micrometer plugin

## Misc
* Fixed a bug in static file handling causing wrong content type for wrapped responses
* Added support for logging of binary responses when `config.devLogging = true`
* Re-introduced the `EventHandler` interface to allow events to throw checked exceptions in Java
* Fixed a bug in JavalinVue where it would fail to walk file system in jars
* Bumped Jetty
