<h1 class="no-margin-top">Javalin 2 to 3 migration guide</h1>

## Configuration
One of the biggest new things in Javalin 3 is the configuration setup.
Server config has been moved away from `Javalin` and into a `JavalinConfig` class, which is
available inside `Javalin.create()`:

```java
Javalin.create(config -> {
    config.addStaticFiles(directory)
    config.autogenerateEtags = true/false
    config.dynamicGzip = true/false
    config.enableDevLogging()
    config.enforceSsl = true/false
    config.requestCacheSize = sizeInBytes
    config.sessionHandler { ... }
    config.server { ... }
    config.accessManager { ... }
}).start()
```

A full list of the config options can be found [in the docs](/documentation#configuration).

## WebSockets
WebSockets used to have 5 separate interfaces with different signatures.
To make the WebSocket API more like the HTTP API, we've introduced `WsContext` in Javalin 3.
Each WebSocket event now takes a `WsContext` (ctx), which also has access to the underlying `Context`
which was used to upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket. We've also added `wsBefore`, `wsAfter`, and `wsException`, and made the
`AccessManager` aware of WebSocket upgrade requests.

You can read more about the new WebSocket API [in the docs](/documentation#websockets).

## Events
Events have been changed from Enum to Config object:

```java
// BEFORE
Javalin app = Javalin.create()
    .event(JavalinEvent.SERVER_STARTING, () -> { ... })
    .event(JavalinEvent.SERVER_STARTED, () -> { ... })
    .event(JavalinEvent.SERVER_START_FAILED, () -> { ... })
// AFTER
Javalin app = Javalin.create().events(event -> {
    event.serverStarting(() -> { ... });
    event.serverStarted(() -> { ... });
    event.serverStartFailed(() -> { ... });
});
```

## Package structure
Javalin 3 has some changes to the package structure. The only class that's still on root (`io.javalin`) is `Javalin`.
Most of what used to be on the root has been moved into `io.javalin.http` (this includes pacakges such as `staticfiles` and `serversentevents`)
Everything related to WebSockets has been moved into `io.javalin.websocket`.
The `io.javalin.security` package has been moved into `io.javalin.core.security`. Plugins have been moved into `io.javalin.plugin`.
