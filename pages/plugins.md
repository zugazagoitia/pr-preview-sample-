{% include pluginCard.html
    title="JavalinVue"
    description="
        JavalinVue let's you create simple Vue frontends without having a frontend build pipeline.
        It uses Vue single-file components with Javalin's server side routing,
        and automatically includes only the Vue code required per route.
        It's ideal for rapid prototyping and creation of websites/web-portals.
